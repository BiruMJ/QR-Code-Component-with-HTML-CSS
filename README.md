## Overview

Here is the project of a QR code component that I have completed successfully using the available design, style-guide and figma software. The project was awesome and it provided me some knowledge of html, css flexbox and designing layout.

  box-shadow: 2px 2px 30px hsla(216, 15%, 48%, 0.077);
